## Documentation

### BLUES using NCMC

This package takes advantage of non-equilibrium candidate Monte Carlo moves (NCMC) to help sample between different ligand binding modes using the OpenMM simulation package.  One goal for this package is to allow for easy additions of other moves of interest, which will be covered below.

### Example Use
An example of how to set up a simulation sampling the binding modes of toluene bound to T4 lysozyme using NCMC and a rotational move can be found in `blues/example.py`

### Actually using BLUES
The heart of the package is found in `blues/ncmc_switching.py`. This holds the framework for NCMC. Particularly, it contains the integrator class that calculates the work done during the NCMC move. It also controls the lambda scaling of parameters. Currently the alchemy package is used to generate the lambda parameters for the ligand, which can potentially modify 5 parametersâ€“sterics, electrostatics, bonds, angles, and torsions.
The `Simulation` class in `blues/simulation.py` serves as a wrapper for running NCMC simulations.

###### For a detailed explanation of the BLUES framework or implementing new moves, check out the [README](devdocs/README.md) in devdocs.

### Implementing Custom moves
Users can implement their own MC moves into NCMC by inheriting from an appropriate `blues.moves.Move` class and constructing a custom `move()` method that only takes in an Openmm context object as a parameter. The `move()` method will then access the positions of that context, change those positions, then update the positions of that context. For example if you would like to add a move that randomly translates a set of coordinates the pseudocode would look similar to this

```python
from blues.moves import Move
class TranslationMove(Move):
   	def __init__(self, atom_indices):
   		self.atom_indices = atom_indices
   	def move(context):
   		positions = context.context.getState(getPositions=True).getPositions(asNumpy=True)
   		#get positions from context
   		#randomly translate atom_indices
   		newPositions = RandomTranslation(positions[atom_indices])
   		context.setPositions(newPositions)
```
