    "## Coupling MD simulations with random NCMC moves for enhanced sampling of ligand binding modes via BLUES\n",
    "  [**BLUES**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11820) is an approach that combines molecular dynamics ([MD](http://www.ch.embnet.org/MD_tutorial/pages/MD.Part1.html)) simulations and the Non-equilibrium Candidate Monte Carlo ([NCMC](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/45/E1009)) framework to enhance ligand binding mode sampling [(Github)](https://github.com/MobleyLab/blues) \n",
    "  \n",
    "During a MD simulation, BLUES will perform a random rotation of the bound ligand and then allow the system to relax through [_alchemically_](http://www.alchemistry.org/wiki/Free_Energy_Fundamentals#Why_the_name_.22Alchemical.22.3F) scaling off/on the ligand-receptor interactions. BLUES enables us to sample alternative ligand binding modes, that would normally take _very_ long simulations to capture in a traditional MD simulation because of the large gap in [timescales](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20934381) between atomistic motions and biological motions.\n"
