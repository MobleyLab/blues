    """
    Makes the dictionary of darting regions used as the basis for darting,
    attempting to make a set of dihedral darts that separate the given poses.
    If all the poses are not separated at this point, translational darts are made,
    and if the remaining poses are not separated, then rotational darts are created.


    Parameters
    ----------
    internal_mat: list of Chemcoord.Zmatrixs
        list of zmats that are to be separated using this function
    pos_list: list
        list of ligand positions
    construction_table: Chemcoord construction_table object
        The construction table used to make the internal_zmat.
    dihedral_cutoff: float, optional, default=0.5
        Minimum cutoff to use for the dihedral dart cutoffs (in radians).
    distance_cutoff: float, optional, default=5.5
        Minimum cutoff to use for the translational cutoffs
    rotation_cutoff: float, optional, default=29.0
        Minimum cutoff to use for the rotation dart cutoffs (in degrees).
    dart_buffer: float, optional, default=0.9
        Specifies how much further to reduce the translational and rotational darting regions so that the chance of overlap is reduced.
    order: list of strs, optional, default=['translation', 'dihedral', 'rotation']
        The order in which to construct the darting regions. Darting regions will be made sequentially.the
        If all the poses are separated by the darting regions at any point in this process, then no additional
        regions will be made (so order matters).
